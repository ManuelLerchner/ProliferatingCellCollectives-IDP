  abstract = {Bacteria self-organize into a dense multicellular community known as a biofilm, in which cells are embedded in self-secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). A number of processes can contribute to spatial heterogeneity in a growing biofilm; among them, the effect of macromolecular crowding enhanced by the EPSs has largely remained unexplored. To understand the effect of macromolecular crowding in spontaneous spatial organization, we develop a computational model to investigate the explicit role of mechanical interactions in driving the collective behavior of bacterial cells in the presence of EPS particles in a colony growing on a solid substrate. Our findings demonstrate that an entropy-driven depletion interaction between bacteria and EPSs can induce significant phase separation and spatial heterogeneity in a biofilm. Secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) by growing bacteria is an integral part of forming biofilm-like structures. In such dense systems, mechanical interactions among the structural components can be expected to significantly contribute to morphological properties. Here, we use a particle-based modeling approach to study the self-organization of nonmotile rod-shaped bacterial cells growing on a solid substrate in the presence of self-produced EPSs. In our simulation, all of the components interact mechanically via repulsive forces, occurring as the bacterial cells grow and divide (via consuming diffusing nutrient) and produce EPSs. Based on our simulation, we show that mechanical interactions control the collective behavior of the system. In particular, we find that the presence of nonadsorbing EPSs can lead to spontaneous aggregation of bacterial cells by a depletion attraction and thereby generates phase separated patterns in the nonequilibrium growing colony. Both repulsive interactions between cell and EPSs and the overall concentration of EPSs are important factors in the self-organization in a nonequilibrium growing colony. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay of mechanics with the nutrient diffusion and consumption by bacterial cells and observe that suppression of branch formation occurs due to EPSs compared with the case where no EPS is produced.}

  abstract = {Microbial biofilms are complex, self-organized communities of bacteria, which employ physiological cooperation and spatial organization to increase both their metabolic efficiency and their resistance to changes in their local environment. These properties make biofilms an attractive target for engineering, particularly for the production of chemicals such as pharmaceutical ingredients or biofuels, with the potential to significantly improve yields and lower maintenance costs. Biofilms are also a major cause of persistent infection, and a better understanding of their organization could lead to new strategies for their disruption. Despite this potential, the design of synthetic biofilms remains a major challenge, due to the complex interplay between transcriptional regulation, intercellular signaling, and cell biophysics. Computational modeling could help to address this challenge by predicting the behavior of synthetic biofilms prior to their construction; however, multiscale modeling has so far not been achieved for realistic cell numbers. This paper presents a computational method for modeling synthetic microbial biofilms, which combines three-dimensional biophysical models of individual cells with models of genetic regulation and intercellular signaling. The method is implemented as a software tool (CellModeller), which uses parallel Graphics Processing Unit architectures to scale to more than 30,000 cells, typical of a 100 Î¼m diameter colony, in 30 min of computation time.}

  abstract     = {The physical interactions of growing bacterial cells with each other and with their surroundings significantly affect the structure and dynamics of biofilms. Here a 3D agent-based model is formulated to describe the establishment of simple bacterial colonies expanding by the physical force of their growth. With a single set of parameters, the model captures key dynamical features of colony growth by non-motile, non EPS-producing \textit{E. coli} cells on hard agar. The model, supported by experiment on colony growth in different types and concentrations of nutrients, suggests that radial colony expansion is not limited by nutrients as commonly believed, but by mechanical forces. Nutrient penetration instead governs vertical colony growth, through thin layers of vertically oriented cells lifting up their ancestors from the bottom. Overall, the model provides a versatile platform to investigate the influences of metabolic and environmental factors on the growth and morphology of bacterial colonies.},

  abstract = {Mechanical stresses stemming from environmental factors are a key determinant of cellular behavior and physiology. Yet, the role of self-induced biomechanical stresses in growing bacterial colonies has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate how collective mechanical forcing plays an important role in the dynamics of the cell size of growing bacteria. We observe that the measured elongation rate of well-nourished Escherichia coli cells decreases over time, depending on the free area around each individual, and associate this behavior with the response of the growing cells to mechanical stresses. Via a cell-resolved model accounting for the feedback of collective forces on individual cell growth, we quantify the effect of this mechano-response on the structure and composition of growing bacterial colonies, including the local environment of each cell. Finally, we predict that a mechano-cross-response between competing bacterial strains with distinct growth rates affects their size distributions.}

It has been confirmed that these concentric ring colonies reflect the periodic change of the bacterial motility between motile cell state and immotile cell state. We conclude that this periodic change is macroscopically determined neither by biological factors (i.e., biological clock) nor by chemical factors (chemotaxis as inhibitor). And our experimental results strongly suggest that the essential factor for the change of the bacterial motility during concentric ring formation is the local cell density.}
