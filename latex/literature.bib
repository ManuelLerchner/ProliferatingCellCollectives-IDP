  abstract = {Bacteria self-organize into a dense multicellular community known as a biofilm, in which cells are embedded in self-secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). A number of processes can contribute to spatial heterogeneity in a growing biofilm; among them, the effect of macromolecular crowding enhanced by the EPSs has largely remained unexplored. To understand the effect of macromolecular crowding in spontaneous spatial organization, we develop a computational model to investigate the explicit role of mechanical interactions in driving the collective behavior of bacterial cells in the presence of EPS particles in a colony growing on a solid substrate. Our findings demonstrate that an entropy-driven depletion interaction between bacteria and EPSs can induce significant phase separation and spatial heterogeneity in a biofilm. Secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) by growing bacteria is an integral part of forming biofilm-like structures. In such dense systems, mechanical interactions among the structural components can be expected to significantly contribute to morphological properties. Here, we use a particle-based modeling approach to study the self-organization of nonmotile rod-shaped bacterial cells growing on a solid substrate in the presence of self-produced EPSs. In our simulation, all of the components interact mechanically via repulsive forces, occurring as the bacterial cells grow and divide (via consuming diffusing nutrient) and produce EPSs. Based on our simulation, we show that mechanical interactions control the collective behavior of the system. In particular, we find that the presence of nonadsorbing EPSs can lead to spontaneous aggregation of bacterial cells by a depletion attraction and thereby generates phase separated patterns in the nonequilibrium growing colony. Both repulsive interactions between cell and EPSs and the overall concentration of EPSs are important factors in the self-organization in a nonequilibrium growing colony. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay of mechanics with the nutrient diffusion and consumption by bacterial cells and observe that suppression of branch formation occurs due to EPSs compared with the case where no EPS is produced.}

  abstract = {Microbial biofilms are complex, self-organized communities of bacteria, which employ physiological cooperation and spatial organization to increase both their metabolic efficiency and their resistance to changes in their local environment. These properties make biofilms an attractive target for engineering, particularly for the production of chemicals such as pharmaceutical ingredients or biofuels, with the potential to significantly improve yields and lower maintenance costs. Biofilms are also a major cause of persistent infection, and a better understanding of their organization could lead to new strategies for their disruption. Despite this potential, the design of synthetic biofilms remains a major challenge, due to the complex interplay between transcriptional regulation, intercellular signaling, and cell biophysics. Computational modeling could help to address this challenge by predicting the behavior of synthetic biofilms prior to their construction; however, multiscale modeling has so far not been achieved for realistic cell numbers. This paper presents a computational method for modeling synthetic microbial biofilms, which combines three-dimensional biophysical models of individual cells with models of genetic regulation and intercellular signaling. The method is implemented as a software tool (CellModeller), which uses parallel Graphics Processing Unit architectures to scale to more than 30,000 cells, typical of a 100 Î¼m diameter colony, in 30 min of computation time.}

Here a 3D agent-based model is formulated to describe the establishment of simple bacterial colonies expanding by the physical force of their growth. With a single set of parameters, the model captures key dynamical features of colony growth by non-motile, non EPS-producing \textit{E. coli} cells on hard agar. The model, supported by experiment on colony growth in different types and concentrations of nutrients, suggests that radial colony expansion is not limited by nutrients as commonly believed, but by mechanical forces. Nutrient penetration instead governs vertical colony growth, through thin layers of vertically oriented cells lifting up their ancestors from the bottom. Overall, the model provides a versatile platform to investigate the influences of metabolic and environmental factors on the growth and morphology of bacterial colonies.},

Yet, the role of self-induced biomechanical stresses in growing bacterial colonies has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate how collective mechanical forcing plays an important role in the dynamics of the cell size of growing bacteria. We observe that the measured elongation rate of well-nourished Escherichia coli cells decreases over time, depending on the free area around each individual, and associate this behavior with the response of the growing cells to mechanical stresses. Via a cell-resolved model accounting for the feedback of collective forces on individual cell growth, we quantify the effect of this mechano-response on the structure and composition of growing bacterial colonies, including the local environment of each cell. Finally, we predict that a mechano-cross-response between competing bacterial strains with distinct growth rates affects their size distributions.}

It has been confirmed that these concentric ring colonies reflect the periodic change of the bacterial motility between motile cell state and immotile cell state. We conclude that this periodic change is macroscopically determined neither by biological factors (i.e., biological clock) nor by chemical factors (chemotaxis as inhibitor). And our experimental results strongly suggest that the essential factor for the change of the bacterial motility during concentric ring formation is the local cell density.}

  abstract = {There exists an extensive literature of algorithms for short-range pairwise interactions in particle simulations, however, there is no single algorithm that performs the most optimally in every scenario, motivating the use of auto-tuning to select the optimal pairwise interaction algorithm. Previous efforts to auto-tune Molecular Dynamics have focused on Single-Site Molecular Dynamics, where the computational cost for the intermolecular force calculation is constant. Alternatively, for Multi-Site Molecular Dynamics, the cost of this calculation varies with the number of sites, which, as we show in this paper, can result in different optimal algorithms. Despite this further benefit for auto-tuning, it has yet to be applied to Multi-Site Molecules. In this paper, we introduce an implementation of Multi-Site Molecular Dynamics that is integrated with AutoPas. Using this implementation, we analyse how the relative performance between these algorithms varies as the number of sites varies, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous molecule distributions, and for two different hardware. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantage of auto-tuning in the context of Multi-Site Molecular Dynamics using the node-level short-range particle simulation library, AutoPas.}

The method is an extension of the GaussâSeidel and GaussâJacobi methods with over-relaxation for symmetric convex linear complementarity problems. Convergent under fairly standard assumptions, the method is implemented in a parallel framework by using a single instruction multiple data computation paradigm promoted by the Compute Unified Device Architecture library for graphical processing unit programming. The framework supports the simulation of problems with more than one million bodies in contact. Simulation thus becomes a viable tool for investigating the dynamics of complex systems such as ground vehicles running on sand, powder composites, and granular material flow. }

  abstract   = {We introduce the first implicit time-stepping algorithm for rigid body dynamics, with contact and friction, that guarantees intersection-free configurations at every time step.Our algorithm explicitly models the curved trajectories traced by rigid bodies in both collision detection and response. For collision detection, we propose a conservative narrow phase collision detection algorithm for curved trajectories, which reduces the problem to a sequence of linear CCD queries with minimal separation. For time integration and contact response, we extend the recently proposed incremental potential contact framework to reduced coordinates and rigid body dynamics.We introduce a benchmark for rigid body simulation and show that our approach, while less efficient than alternatives, can robustly handle a wide array of complex scenes, which cannot be simulated with competing methods, without requiring per-scene parameter tuning.},

  abstract     = {The cytoskeleton â a collection of polymeric filaments, molecular motors, and crosslinkers â is a foundational example of active matter, and in the cell assembles into organelles that guide basic biological functions. Simulation of cytoskeletal assemblies is an important tool for modeling cellular processes and understanding their surprising material properties. Here, we present \textit{aLENS} (a Living Ensemble Simulator), a novel computational framework designed to surmount the limits of conventional simulation methods. We model molecular motors with crosslinking kinetics that adhere to a thermodynamic energy landscape, and integrate the system dynamics while efficiently and stably enforcing hard-body repulsion between filaments. Molecular potentials are entirely avoided in imposing steric constraints. Utilizing parallel computing, we simulate tens to hundreds of thousands of cytoskeletal filaments and crosslinking motors, recapitulating emergent phenomena such as bundle formation and buckling. This simulation framework can help elucidate how motor type, thermal fluctuations, internal stresses, and confinement determine the evolution of cytoskeletal active matter.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages are viral predators of bacteria. Understanding the bacteria-phage competition is crucial for horizontal gene transfer and treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we investigate the interaction dynamics between common rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and lytic phages within 2D and 3D environments. Our computational study is based on established experimental observations of bacteria-phage interactions. A lytic phage effectively kills bacterial cells in a colony, leading to significant consequences for its morphology and expansion. Through computational modeling, we observe that phage interactions with bacteria produce phage-plaque regions characterized by cell death, reorganization, and altered colony growth dynamics. As phages predate, surviving cells tend to re-align toward the phage-affected region, forming a more ordered structure. This reordering effect not only reduces the radial spread of the colony but, in highly virulent scenarios, generates an inflow of cells toward the phage-plaque, effectively âdevouringâ portions of the colony. Our work highlights how phages control the self-organization of proliferating active matter and offers insights into targeted approaches for managing bacterial populations in biofilm-associated environments.},

  abstract = {Competition between random genetic drift and natural selection play a central role in evolution: Whereas nonbeneficial mutations often prevail in small populations by chance, mutations that sweep through large populations typically confer a selective advantage. Here, however, we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined, sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial and yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable footprint of past range expansions.}

  abstract = {Microbes often live in dense populations such as colonies and biofilms. We show that the success and extinction of yeast strains within a growing colony are determined by a combination of their relative fitness and the forces exerted by proliferating cells on their neighbors. These physical interactions prolong the survival of less-fit strains at the growing frontier of the colony and slow down the colonyâs takeover by fitter strains. This reduction in the power of natural selection favors the maintenance of genetic diversity in environments in which the strainsâ relative growth rates vary with time. Growth-induced physical interactions may thus favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells, which are typically less fit than nonresistant cells, within dense microbial populations. Microbial populations often assemble in dense populations in which proliferating individuals exert mechanical forces on the nearby cells. Here, we use yeast strains whose doubling times depend differently on temperature to show that physical interactions among cells affect the competition between different genotypes in growing yeast colonies. Our experiments demonstrate that these physical interactions have two related effects: they cause the prolonged survival of slower-growing strains at the actively-growing frontier of the colony and cause faster-growing strains to increase their frequency more slowly than expected in the absence of physical interactions. These effects also promote the survival of slower-growing strains and the maintenance of genetic diversity in colonies grown in time-varying environments. A continuum model inspired by overdamped hydrodynamics reproduces the experiments and predicts that the strength of natural selection depends on the width of the actively growing layer at the colony frontier. We verify these predictions experimentally. The reduced power of natural selection observed here may favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells in microbial populations and could explain the apparent neutrality of interclone competition within tumors.}

However, their performance depends critically on the choice of the reference material. Only for finitely contrasted materials, optimum-selection strategies are known. This work focuses on adaptive strategies for choosing the reference material, details their efficient implementation, and investigates the computational performance. The case of porous materials is explicitly included. As a byproduct, we introduce a suitable convergence criterion that permits a fair comparison to strain-based FFT solvers and EyreâMilton type implementations.},
