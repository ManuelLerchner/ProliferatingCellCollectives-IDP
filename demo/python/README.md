# Python Demo

This folder contains a Python demo for proliferating cell collectives.

+ **/hard** - Contains a constraint solver based simulation solving guaranteeing a no-overlap condition between bacterial cells.
+ **/soft** - Contains a simpler rigid body simulation that allows for overlap between cells, and uses Herzian contact forces to prevent cells from penetrating each other too much.
