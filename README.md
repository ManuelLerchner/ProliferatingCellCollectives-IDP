## Abstract

This work compares hard (constraint-based) and soft (potential-based) collision models for simulating proliferating cell collectives by implementing both approaches within a unified computational framework. Building on the foundational work of Weady et al. [1], we systematically benchmark their performance on bacterial colony growth simulations.

Both approaches successfully reproduce experimentally observed patterns, including concentric rings and microdomain formation. However, they exhibit distinct computational and physical trade-offs. The hard model enforces strict non-overlap and stabilizes at timesteps approximately $30\times$ larger than the soft model ($\Delta t \approx 3 \times 10^{-4}$ h versus $10^{-5}$ h), at higher per-step computational cost. The soft model suffers from numerical stiffness and allows unphysical cell overlap, producing packing fractions exceeding 5 in colony centers compared to the hard model's realistic packing fraction of 0.9.

Moreover, we introduce an adaptive timestepping algorithm based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, which dynamically selects stable timesteps tailored to the current colony state. Benchmarking reveals the hard model outperforms the soft model for small to moderate colonies ($R \leq 100$), while the soft model's superior scalability enables larger final colony sizes ($R \approx 200$) within practical runtimes.

Despite microscopic differences in packing and stress distributions, both models yield comparable macroscopic patterns, suggesting colony-level behavior is robust to collision model details. The soft model provides an efficient, biologically plausible alternative for large-scale studies, while the hard model remains valuable when precise stress calculations or geometric integrity are required.

## Code

### Usage

The code is written in C++ and can be compiled using the following command:

```bash
cd demo/cpp/hard
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

The executable can be run with the following command to see the available options:

```bash
./cellcollectives -help
```

The executable can also be run with `mpirun` to run the simulation using multiple processes:

```bash
mpirun -n 16 ./cellcollectives -mode "hard"
```

### Results

Running the simulation produces output data in `build/src/vtk_output_{mode}` folder.

This data can be conviniently visualized using Paraview using the provided `ParticleDebugger.pvsm` file in the `visualization` folder.
Further scripts are providied in the `/analysis` folder to analyze the simulation data and produce the figures in the thesis.
