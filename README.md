## Abstract

This work extends the hard (constraint-based) collision model introduced by Weady et al.~\cite{Weady2024} by systematically comparing it with a soft (potential-based) approach for simulating proliferating cell collectives. Both models are implemented within a unified computational framework, enabling direct benchmarking of bacterial colony growth.

Our results show that both approaches reproduce key experimentally observed patterns, including concentric rings and microdomain formation, but they involve distinct trade-offs. The hard model permits timesteps roughly 30 times larger than the soft model and achieves runtimes up to 9.36$\times$ faster. In contrast, the soft model suffers from numerical stiffness and allows unphysical cell overlap, producing packing fractions exceeding 5 in colony centers compared to the hard model's realistic 0.9.

We also introduce an adaptive timestepping algorithm based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition to dynamically select stable timesteps. Benchmarking reveals the hard model consistently outperforms the soft model across all colony sizes, successfully simulating colonies up to $R \approx 260$ with approximately 301,116 cells while maintaining physical accuracy.

Despite microscopic differences in packing and stress, both models produce similar macroscopic patterns at small scales, indicating that colony-level behavior exhibits some robustness to the collision resolution method. However, the soft model's severe overcrowding and distorted stress distributions make it unsuitable for quantitative analysis or large-scale simulations. We find that the hard model is strongly preferred for nearly all applications, offering both superior computational performance and physically meaningful results.

## Code

### Usage

The code is written in C++ and can be compiled using the following command:

```bash
cd demo/cpp/hard
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

The executable can be run with the following command to see the available options:

```bash
./cellcollectives -help
```

The executable can also be run with `mpirun` to run the simulation using multiple processes:

```bash
mpirun -n 16 ./cellcollectives -mode "hard"
```

### Results

Running the simulation produces output data in `build/src/vtk_output_{mode}` folder.

This data can be conviniently visualized using Paraview using the provided `ParticleDebugger.pvsm` file in the `visualization` folder.
Further scripts are providied in the `/analysis` folder to analyze the simulation data and produce the figures in the thesis.
